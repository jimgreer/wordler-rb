Wordler is a simple AI to play Wordle in hard mode

It makes guesses, and you tell it how it did.

For example:

```
Welcome to Wordler!
I'll make guesses, and you tell me the result
You type "g" for green, "y" for yellow, and "." for grey

I guess AROSE
Enter results (for example "ggy...") or "q" to quit
> y..g.

I guess CLASH
Enter results (for example "ggy...") or "q" to quit
> ..yg.

I guess DAISY
Enter results (for example "ggy...") or "q" to quit
> ggggg

I win. Let's play again!
```

You can try it live on Replit, or clone it and launch by running
```
ruby lib/player.rb
```

I'm no AI expert, so the algorithm is quite simple. Suggestions and contributions welcome!
